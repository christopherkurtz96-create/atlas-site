User may provide a focus:

If no focus provided, research across all services and locations.

## Research Process

### Step 1: Understand Current Context

**Review existing content**:
- Check existing service pages for content gaps
- Review location pages for optimization opportunities
- Identify services without dedicated pages
- Find locations without pages

**User intent understanding**:
- If user provided a focus area, note it
- If not, research broadly across all services and locations

### Step 2: Local Keyword Discovery

**Use WebSearch to research local keywords**:

#### Pattern 1: Service + Location Keywords
```
Search patterns:
- "[service] Columbia MO"
- "[service] near me Columbia"
- "[service] contractor Columbia Missouri"
- "[service] company Mid-Missouri"
```

Example searches:
- "excavation Columbia MO"
- "demolition contractor Columbia Missouri"
- "land clearing near me Columbia"
- "foundation excavation Mid-Missouri"

#### Pattern 2: Service + City Combinations
For each service, research keywords for each city:
```
- "excavation [city] MO" for all service areas
- "demolition [city] Missouri"
- "[service] near [city]"
```

#### Pattern 3: Question-Based Local Keywords
```
- "how much does [service] cost in Missouri"
- "who does [service] in Columbia MO"
- "best [service] company Columbia"
- "[service] permits Columbia MO"
```

#### Pattern 4: Problem/Solution Keywords
```
- "drainage problems Columbia MO"
- "remove old foundation Missouri"
- "mobile home removal cost"
- "septic installation requirements Missouri"
```

#### Pattern 5: Long-Tail Local Keywords
```
- "[service] for new construction Columbia MO"
- "residential [service] Boone County"
- "commercial [service] Mid-Missouri"
- "[service] for [specific use] Columbia"
```

### Step 3: Analyze Search Intent & Local Opportunity

For each keyword, assess:

**Search Intent** (classify as):
- **Local Transactional**: "excavation contractor Columbia MO" (ready to hire)
- **Local Informational**: "excavation costs Missouri" (researching)
- **Commercial Investigation**: "best demolition company Columbia" (comparing)
- **Navigational**: Brand searches

**Local Opportunity Score** (1-10):
Prioritize in this order:
1. **Local Intent Match**: Does this keyword show local hiring intent?
2. **Business Relevance**: Does Atlas offer this exact service?
3. **Location Specificity**: Is it targeting our service area?
4. **Competition Level**: Can we realistically rank for this?
5. **Search Volume**: Even 10-50/mo is valuable for local service businesses

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Service + Primary Location (Columbia) + hiring intent = 8-10
- Service + Secondary Location + hiring intent = 7-9
- Educational content with local angle = 5-7
- Generic educational content = 3-5

## Best Practices

### Local SEO Specifics
- **Always include location**: Every piece of content should mention Columbia, MO and/or specific service areas
- **Use natural location mentions**: "Columbia homeowners" not just "Columbia" stuffed in
- **Include phone number**: (573) 200-6499 should appear prominently
- **NAP consistency**: Name, Address, Phone must match GBP exactly everywhere
- **Local landmarks**: Reference well-known local areas when relevant

### Content Quality
- **Specificity wins**: "House demolition in Columbia" beats generic "demolition services"
- **Answer real questions**: What would a Columbia homeowner actually Google?
- **Show expertise**: Mention Missouri-specific regulations, soil conditions, weather considerations
- **Include CTAs**: Every page should have clear next step (call, form, estimate)

### GBP Best Practices
- **Post consistently**: Minimum weekly, ideally 2-3x per week
- **Respond to reviews**: Within 24-48 hours, always professional
- **Update photos**: Add new project photos monthly
- **Monitor Q&A**: Answer questions quickly, pre-populate common ones
- **Use all features**: Posts, products/services, Q&A, updates

### Competitive Awareness
- **Don't just copy**: Find gaps competitors haven't filled
- **Monitor rankings**: Track "excavation Columbia MO" and key terms
- **Watch for new competitors**: Set up alerts for new businesses
- **Differentiate**: Emphasize "old school grit + modern efficiency" messaging

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too generic**: "Excavation services" without location
✅ **Location-specific**: "Excavation services in Columbia, MO"

❌ **Ignoring secondary cities**: Only targeting Columbia
✅ **Full coverage**: Content for all service areas

❌ **Neglecting GBP**: Only focusing on website SEO
✅ **GBP priority**: GBP often drives more local leads than website

❌ **One-time effort**: Creating content and forgetting
✅ **Ongoing**: Regular posts, updates, new content

❌ **Keyword stuffing**: "Columbia MO excavation Columbia Missouri excavation"
✅ **Natural integration**: "As Columbia's trusted excavation contractor..."

❌ **No CTAs**: Educational content without next steps
✅ **Clear CTAs**: "Call (573) 200-6499 for a free estimate"

## Success Metrics

Track these after implementing recommendations:
- Google Business Profile views and actions
- Website traffic from local searches
- Ranking positions for "[service] Columbia MO" keywords
- Phone calls from website and GBP
- Form submissions
- Review count and rating

## Handoff

After completing discovery, output should be ready for:
1. Content creation (blog posts, service pages)
2. GBP optimization implementation
3. New location page creation
4. Website updates

User can proceed directly to creating content or request additional research on specific topics.
